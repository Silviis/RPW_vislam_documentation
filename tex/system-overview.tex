\chapter{System Overview and Architecture}\label{ch:system-overview}
This chapter provides an overview of the system architecture and its components.
It describes how the various modules interact to achieve the desired functionality.
Section \ref{sec:hw-overview} details the hardware components used in the system,
while Section \ref{sec:sw-overview} outlines the software architecture and its design principles.

\section{Hardware overview}\label{sec:hw-overview}
The hardware setup consists of a single board computer, a stereo camera, and an
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The single board computer serves as the main processing
unit, handling data acquisition, processing, and running the SLAM algorithms. The stereo
camera captures visual data from the environment, while the IMU provides motion and
orientation information. The IMU sensor is located on the same board as the camera.

Here is a detailed list of the hardware components used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Board Computer}: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Volta GPU with 384 CUDA cores and 48 Tensor cores
        \item 6-core NVIDIA Carmel Arm v8.2 64-bit CPU
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{IMX219-83 Stereo Camera + IMU}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2 × 8-megapixel cameras, 3280 × 2464 resolution
        \item Sony IMX219 sensor
        \item ICM-20948 9-axis IMU (3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 3-axis magnetometer)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Software architecture}\label{sec:sw-overview}
The software architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy
integration of new features and components. Docker is used for containerization to ensure
consistent environments across different deployment platforms, as well as to simplify 
development and deployment processes. There are two separate Docker containers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ros2\_cam}: This container is responsible for running
    \item \textbf{ros2\_slam}: This container handles
\end{itemize}
