\chapter{System Overview and Architecture}\label{ch:system-overview}
This chapter provides an overview of the system architecture and its components.
It describes how the various modules interact to achieve the desired functionality.


\section{Hardware overview}


\section{Software architecture}
The software architecture is designed to be modular and scalable, allowing for easy
integration of new features and components. Docker is used for containerization to ensure
consistent environments across different deployment platforms, as well as to simplify 
development and deployment processes. There are two separate Docker containers:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{ros2\_cam}: This container is responsible for running
    \item \textbf{ros2\_slam}: This container handles
\end{itemize}
