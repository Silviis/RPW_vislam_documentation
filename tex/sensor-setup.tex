\subsection{Camera Intrinsic Calibration}\label{sec:cam_intrinsic_calibration}
We used the Kalibr toolbox  for intrinsic camera calibration.
The calibration process involved capturing multiple images of a known calibration pattern
from different angles and distances. The Kalibr toolbox then processed these images to
estimate the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, including focal length, principal point,
and distortion coefficients.

\subsection{IMU Intrinsic Calibration}\label{sec:imu_intrinsic_calibration}


\subsection{Extrinsic camera-IMU calibration}\label{sec:extrinsic_calibration}
The extrinsic calibration between the stereo camera and the IMU was also performed using
the Kalibr toolbox \cite{Furgale2013}. This process involved capturing synchronized data
