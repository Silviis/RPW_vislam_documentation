\section{Calibration}\label{sec:calibration}
This subsection details the processes for the intrinsic calibration of both cameras and the IMU, as well as the extrinsic calibration of the whole sensor setup.

\subsection{Camera Calibration}\label{sec:cam_intrinsic_calibration}
We used the Kalibr toolbox  for intrinsic camera calibration.


The calibration process involved capturing multiple images of a known calibration pattern
from different angles and distances with the stereo camera setup. This was done to acquire the following intrinsic parameters: 
focal lengths $f_x$ and $f_y$, principal points $c_x$ and $c_y$, 

The Kalibr toolbox then processed these images to
estimate the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, including focal length, principal point,
and distortion coefficients.

\subsection{IMU Intrinsic Calibration}\label{sec:imu_intrinsic_calibration}


\subsection{Extrinsic camera-IMU calibration}\label{sec:extrinsic_calibration}
The extrinsic calibration between the stereo camera and the IMU was also performed using
the Kalibr toolbox \cite{extending_kalibr}. This process involved capturing synchronized data
