  abstract   = {An increasing number of robotic systems feature multiple inertial measurement units ({IMUs}). Due to competing objectives-either desired vicinity to the center of gravity when used in controls, or an unobstructed field of view when integrated in a sensor setup with an exteroceptive sensor for ego-motion estimation-individual {IMUs} are often mounted at considerable distance. As a result, they sense different accelerations when the platform is subjected to rotational motions. In this work, we derive a method for spatially calibrating multiple {IMUs} in a single estimator based on the open-source camera/{IMU} calibration toolbox kalibr. We further extend the toolbox to determine {IMU} intrinsics, enabling accurate calibration of low-cost {IMUs}. The results suggest that the extended estimator is capable of precisely determining these intrinsics and even of localizing individual accelerometer axes inside a commercial grade {IMU} to millimeter precision.},
