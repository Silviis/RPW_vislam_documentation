  abstract   = {An increasing number of robotic systems feature multiple inertial measurement units ({IMUs}). Due to competing objectives-either desired vicinity to the center of gravity when used in controls, or an unobstructed field of view when integrated in a sensor setup with an exteroceptive sensor for ego-motion estimation-individual {IMUs} are often mounted at considerable distance. As a result, they sense different accelerations when the platform is subjected to rotational motions. In this work, we derive a method for spatially calibrating multiple {IMUs} in a single estimator based on the open-source camera/{IMU} calibration toolbox kalibr. We further extend the toolbox to determine {IMU} intrinsics, enabling accurate calibration of low-cost {IMUs}. The results suggest that the extended estimator is capable of precisely determining these intrinsics and even of localizing individual accelerometer axes inside a commercial grade {IMU} to millimeter precision.},

  abstract   = {In order to increase accuracy and robustness in state estimation for robotics, a growing number of applications rely on data from multiple complementary sensors. For the best performance in sensor fusion, these different sensors must be spatially and temporally registered with respect to each other. To this end, a number of approaches have been developed to estimate these system parameters in a two stage process, ﬁrst estimating the time offset and subsequently solving for the spatial transformation between sensors.},
