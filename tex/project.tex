\section{Project Timeline and Management}
% how the project was planned and executed
At the start of the project, a Gantt chart was created to help with scheduling and project management. The Gantt graph has two main sections, setting up the VI-SLAM and then testing it. Both sections were furthermore split into sub-sections to more easily identify and quantify the needed tasks.
